This is a suite of tools to assist with Jumpstarting Solaris clients.

It offers a simple script to install CD and DVD images, which automatically
handles loopback mounting, compression, and series of CDs.

Clients are configured through a single, simple command, with configuration
stored in flat files in a unique directory. This makes it simple to clone
and tweak configurations. A range of finish scripts are available to
configure machines, and it's easy to add your own.

I have been using these tools in a number of production and lab environments
for a few years now, so they're pretty battle-hardened.

Though this lacks some of the more advanced features of JET, I think it's a
lot quicker to learn, and faster and simpler to use.
