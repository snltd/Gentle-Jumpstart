In this directory, create a subdirectory for each of your networks. For
instance, 192.168.1.0. Inside that directory you can create files such as
defaultrouter, netmasks, nsswitch.conf, ntp.conf and resolv.conf, which will
be picked up by the relevant finish scripts. You can have as many networks
as you like.
